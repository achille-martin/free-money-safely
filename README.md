# free-money-safely

## Purpose

This repo is intended to help people collect some free money in a safe and respectable way.

## Strategy

The technique used to collect free money relies on "free lotteries".

A "free lottery" is a lottery which is supported with advertising and lets people join "for free". It can be based on multiple varibles (for instance residential address) and consists in daily draws. The winner of the daily draw must visit the website of the lottery to figure out whether they have won or not and they need to be the first amongs players at the same address (in the example) to claim the prize.

The challenge with "free lottery" is that it is:
* Time-consuming: need to check the results daily
* Luck-based: the winning draw can happen any date but it can't be predicted
* Competitive: multiple people might compete to get the same prize (and only the fastest gets it)

To solve these 3 problems, a robot server will be:
* Checking the results daily
* Reporting any winning draw to the user/master
* Claim the prize before everyone else if possible
